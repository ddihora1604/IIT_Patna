# Ridor-like Rule-Based Classifier Explanation

## Overview of the Algorithm

The Ridor-like classifier implemented here is a rule-based classification algorithm inspired by the original Ridor (RIpple-DOwn Rule learner) from the Weka suite. Unlike traditional decision tree algorithms, this approach:

1. Identifies a default class (typically the majority class)
2. Generates exception rules for non-default classes
3. Creates a hierarchical set of rules that are easy to interpret
4. Prioritizes rules in a specific order during prediction

The main advantage of this approach is the production of human-readable classification rules that can provide insights into the decision-making process.

## Implementation Details

This custom implementation creates a Ridor-like classifier using scikit-learn's framework:

- **Base Architecture**: Custom implementation extending scikit-learn's BaseEstimator and ClassifierMixin
- **Rule Generation**: Uses decision trees to create rules for each non-default class
- **Rule Extraction**: Converts decision paths from trees into readable IF-THEN rules
- **Evaluation**: K-fold cross-validation (K=2) with comprehensive metrics
- **Visualization**: Confusion matrices, feature importance, and class distributions

Key implementation features:
- Automatic determination of the default class (majority class)
- Generation of binary classification problems for each non-default class
- Extraction of human-readable rules from decision trees
- Rule coverage tracking and application order management
- Saving generated rules to text files for later analysis

## Results and Observations

The implementation provides several analytics:
- Per-class and per-fold performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)
- Matthews Correlation Coefficient and Cohen's Kappa scores
- Confusion matrices for visual performance assessment
- Feature importance analysis to identify key predictive features
- True/False Positive/Negative Rates for deeper performance analysis
- Training and inference time measurements

The rules extracted from the model are saved in both raw text format and CSV format, allowing for detailed inspection of the decision-making logic used by the classifier.

## Conclusion

This Ridor-like classifier provides interpretable results without requiring Java-based dependencies, making it more accessible and maintainable in Python-based machine learning pipelines.

The implementation strikes a balance between performance and interpretability, which is crucial for domains where understanding the model's reasoning is as important as its predictive accuracy. The rule-based nature makes it particularly suitable for applications where decisions need to be explained to stakeholders or domain experts.

The comprehensive evaluation framework allows for detailed performance analysis, while the saved rules enable closer examination of the model's internal logic and decision criteria.
