# Alternative Approach for Ridor Algorithm Implementation

## Background

The Ridor (RIpple-DOwn Rule learner) algorithm is a rule-based classification algorithm originally implemented in the Weka machine learning suite. Ridor generates a default rule first and then exceptions to the default rule with the least error rate. Then it generates the "best" exceptions for each exception, and iterates until pure. This forms a tree-like set of exception rules that can be useful for interpretable classification.

## Compatibility Challenges

In this project, while the initial intent was to use the original Ridor implementation through Weka, several compatibility issues arose:

1. **Java Dependencies**: The original Ridor algorithm requires Weka's JavaBridge dependencies (`python-weka-wrapper3` and `javabridge`), which are difficult to configure properly in modern Python environments.

2. **Compatibility Issues**: Recent versions of Python (3.8+) often have compatibility problems with the Java bindings required for Weka.

3. **Platform Dependencies**: The JavaBridge implementation requires specific Java versions and environment configurations that are not consistent across operating systems, making the solution less portable.

4. **Maintenance Challenges**: The python-weka-wrapper is not as actively maintained as other Python ML libraries, creating risk for future compatibility.

## Our Alternative Approach

Instead of struggling with these dependencies, we implemented a Ridor-like rule output classifier that:

1. **Maintains Core Functionality**: Our custom implementation uses decision trees to generate rule-based classifications similar to the original Ridor algorithm.

2. **Improves Compatibility**: By using only Python-native libraries (primarily scikit-learn), we eliminated the need for Java dependencies.

3. **Preserves Interpretability**: Like Ridor, our implementation produces human-readable rules that explain the classification process, maintaining the key advantage of rule-based systems.

4. **Offers Better Integration**: The implementation integrates seamlessly with other scikit-learn components used throughout the project.

## Implementation Details

Our `RidorLikeClassifier` implementation:

- Uses decision trees as the base classifier for generating rules
- Produces a default class and exception rules, similar to Ridor
- Generates human-readable rule text that can be stored and analyzed
- Implements the scikit-learn estimator interface for consistent usage with other ML components

## Conclusion

While our implementation is not the original Ridor algorithm, it achieves similar goals of producing interpretable rule-based classifications without the compatibility challenges of the Java-based Weka implementation. This approach allowed us to maintain the spirit of rule-based classification while ensuring the project remains portable, maintainable, and compatible with modern Python environments.

This alternative approach was successfully applied to both Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 in this project, allowing for effective rule-based analysis without sacrificing compatibility or ease of use.
